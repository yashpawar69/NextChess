# **App Name**: NextChess

## Core Features:

- Chessboard UI: Use `react-chessboard` to render the chessboard. Use `chess.js` to manage the game logic (legal moves, checkmate, etc.). Allow the user to play both sides or play against an AI.
- Game Timers: Show individual countdown timers for both white and black. Each timer should switch on the user's move.
- Theme Toggle: Allow switching between light and dark themes. Use Tailwind CSS's `dark:` utilities for styling.
